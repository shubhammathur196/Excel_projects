**Excel Dashboard Repository
This repository contains a collection of Excel dashboards that I created while learning about Excel. The dashboards include pivot tables, various visuals like graphs and charts, and interactive elements.

Dashboards in the repository: 

1. Bike Sales Dashboard: Charts and graphs of average age per purchase, age bracket of the customers, and customer commute. Includes filters for marital status, region, and education.

2. McDonald's Sales Dashboard: Uses data from South America (2022) and includes pie charts of total sales, profit, and % of customers. Shows sales trend from 2021 - 2022 and customer satisfaction.

3. Coca Cola Dashboard: Shows total sales and units sold for key American retailers, with monthly sales and filtering by sales period.

4. Coronavirus Analysis Dashboard: Analysis of cases, deaths, and recoveries for the top 10 countries with the most cases. Includes a sum of total deaths and filters for countries.

How to Use
To use these dashboards, download the Excel files and open them in Excel. The dashboards are designed to be user-friendly, with clear labels and interactive elements that allow users to explore the data in different ways.

Customization
These dashboards are meant to be templates that can be customized to suit your specific needs. You can modify the data sources, add or remove charts and tables, and adjust the formatting to match your branding or preferences.

Feedback and Contributions
I welcome feedback on these dashboards, as well as contributions from other Excel users who have created their own dashboards. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have suggestions or improvements to share.
